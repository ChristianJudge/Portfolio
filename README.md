## Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study 🚲  
Data analysis case study of the Cyclistic bike-share program (fictional company) using R.

### 📌 Overview  
About the company 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown 
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across 
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the 
system anytime.  
This project analyzes Cyclistic's bike-share data to identify usage patterns of casual riders vs. annual members. The goal is to develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.  

### 📊 Data  
- **Source:** Public datasets from Motivate International Inc.  (Divvy_Trips_Q1)
- **Time Period:** Q1 2019 & Q1 2020  
- **Contents:** Bike trip records with timestamps, user types, ride duration, and station data.  

### 🔍 Key Questions  
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
2. What factors influence casual riders to buy memberships?  
3. How can we identify dominant demographic areas?  

### 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Programming Language:** R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)  
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, RMarkdown, jupyter notebook  
- **Data Storage:** CSV files
