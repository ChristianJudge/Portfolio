## Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study 🚲  
Data analysis case study of the Cyclistic bike-share program (fictional company) using R.

### 📌 Overview  
About the company 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown 
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across 
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the 
system anytime.  
This project analyzes Cyclistic's bike-share data to identify usage patterns of casual riders vs. annual members. The goal is to develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.  

### 📊 Data  
- **Source:** Public datasets from Motivate International Inc.  (Divvy_Trips_Q1)
- **Time Period:** Q1 2019 & Q1 2020  
- **Contents:** Bike trip records with timestamps, user types, ride duration, and station data.  

### 🔍 Key Questions  
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
2. What factors influence casual riders to buy memberships?  
3. How can we identify patterns in demographic areas?  

### 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Programming Language:** R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)  
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, RMarkdown, jupyter notebook  
- **Data Storage:** CSV files

## Conclusion
In analyzing Cyclistic’s bike usage patterns, key insights emerged that can guide strategic decisions. Annual members take more frequent rides but for shorter durations, whereas casual riders opt for fewer yet longer trips. This indicates that members integrate bike usage into their daily routines, while casual riders may use them more for leisure. Additionally, among the top 10 cities, all but one are predominantly member-based, making that high-casual-user city a prime target for membership marketing efforts. Time preferences also vary, with members riding slightly earlier in the day than casual users. Demographically, analysis using facet_wrap() revealed that the predominant age for members is 30, while for casual users it is 25. This suggests that strategic marketing campaigns targeting the 24-26 age group could be vital for optimizing casual user conversion to membership. These findings highlight opportunities for targeted promotions, improved service offerings, and strategies to convert casual riders into loyal members.
